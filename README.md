This program is written to play a game of rock, paper, scissors with the user. The game asks for user input (rock, paper, scissors), and also picks an option simultaneously. Then it acknowledges the winner and counts the points for both the computer as well as the user. The game runs until 'q' is pressed upon which the game terminates. Once terminated, the winner is announced.
